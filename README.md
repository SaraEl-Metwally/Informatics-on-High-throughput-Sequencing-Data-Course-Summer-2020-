# Informatics-on-High-throughput-Sequencing-Data-Course-Summer-2020-
This is a summer training course at CCIC (Faculty of Computers and Information), Mansoura University, Egypt. 
## Course Description / aims
<p align="justify">
The contents of this workshop are prepared to introduce Bioinformatics as the intersection of informatics and Biology, and how Bioinformatics play an important rule in different areas of our life ranging from agricultural, environmental sciences to our healthcare system. Bioinformatics research has been accelerated with the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing, NGS, machines. These machines produce a deluge of genomic data that is required to clean, manage, process, analyze, and interpret to have a clear understanding of our biological system. We will help you in this course to gain different skills that are required to start your career as a Bioinformatician.</p>

## Target audience
<p align="justify">
Undergraduate and graduate-level students in biology, medicine, science, agriculture, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics and other related fields.</p>
